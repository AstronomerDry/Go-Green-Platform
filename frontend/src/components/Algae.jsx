    <p>An algae purifier typically refers to a device or system designed to remove algae from water, often used in aquariums, ponds, or water treatment facilities. These systems can employ various methods such as UV sterilization, mechanical filtration, or chemical treatments to control and eliminate algae growth. Algae purifiers help maintain water clarity, improve the health of aquatic life, and prevent issues related to excessive algae buildup. This system is equivalent to two 10-year-old trees or 200 square meters of grass. The advantage of microalgae compared to trees is that they are about 10-50 times more efficient than trees.
