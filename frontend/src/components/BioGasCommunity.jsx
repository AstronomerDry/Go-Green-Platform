              <p>The community establishes a regular schedule for collecting biodegradable waste. This can be done daily or on specific days of the week. The collected biodegradable waste is transported to the community biogas plant. This can be done using dedicated vehicles or carts.
              At the biogas plant, the waste is further processed. Non-biodegradable materials accidentally mixed in are removed, and the biodegradable waste is fed into anaerobic digesters</p>
