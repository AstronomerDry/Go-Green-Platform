              <p>The anaerobic digesters break down the organic waste, producing biogas (a mixture of methane and carbon dioxide) and a nutrient-rich slurry, which can be used as fertilizer.

Utilization: The biogas is collected and can be used for cooking, heating, or generating electricity. The slurry is often distributed back to the community as compost or fertilizer.

By involving the community in these steps, the process becomes more efficient and sustainable. This approach reduces the amount of waste sent to landfills, produces renewable energy, and provides organic fertilizer for gardening and agriculture.</p>
